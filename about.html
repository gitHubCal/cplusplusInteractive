                <h3>Interactive C++</h3>
                <p>The Interactice C++ platform was inspired by blah blah blah, and this is text that is supposed to be not distracting. I can't really remember the lorem ipsum text that you're supposed to use in situations like these, and I don't have internet access at the moment, so I can't exactly search it up at the moment. As a result, I am making up text as I go along. I just hope that it won't be too distracting to look at. I just need to fill up some space so that I can see how the page will look when the actual text is inserted. There will probably be several sections in this, so it's time to move onto the second one.</p>

                <h3>Another Section</h3>
                <p>Probably gonna split it into stuff like our Mission, and our Company, and potentially our Vision, because I want people to know where the site is theoretically heading. Plus there are other projects in mind, so I hope they will be equally successful. I actually need to add more text to this section, as there isn't enough to fill up the webpage fully. It's a little weird to use a framework, as I've never done it before. I guess I need some more practice, but this whole thing is strange. It's weird that everything has a margin in percentage, because for example the top buttons have a border between them. Perhaps I can change that in the main.css stylesheet that I put together.</p>
